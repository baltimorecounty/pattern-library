title: Default checkboxes and radio buttons
---
Checkboxes are for selecting one or several options in a list, while radios are for selecting one option from many.

Disabled checkboxes and radios are supported, but to provide a "not-allowed" cursor on hover of the parent ```&lt;label&gt;```, you'll need to add the ```.disabled``` class to the parent ```.radio```, ```.radio-inline```, ```.checkbox```, or ```.checkbox-inline```.
