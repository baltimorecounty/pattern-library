Our official icon set is [Font Awesome](http://fontawesome.io/), an open-source web font.

Font Awesome includes more than 600 icons. To keep our user interface consistent, we've approved a subset of icons for specific uses. If you need an icon that's not on this list, please consult a Designer or Front End Engineer.

To include an icon on a page, simply reference the classes outlined below.

**Usage Guidelines**

Font Awesome icons will inherit color, size and other properties from parent elements. To change basic styling:

* Target the icon class to change text or background color.
* Apply Font Awesome helper classes such as .fa-2x to change the size or behavior of an icon.
* Always check with Designer and/or Frontend Engineer for guidance on styling and sizing icons.
