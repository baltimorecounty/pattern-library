For our panels we are using the [Bootstrap Panels Component](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#panels). Follow their [guide](http://getbootstrap.com/components/#panels) for implementation.

A [card](http://localhost:3000/?p=viewall-molecules-cards) can be used in place of a panel.

A card must be contained in a grid column.
